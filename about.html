            <p class="title ">THE COMPANY</p>
            <p>Daloy Dance Company started with artistic director, Ea Torrado’s vision of generating daring and evocative dance theatre pieces with an ever-evolving group of dancers, actors and artists from diverse backgrounds.</p>
            
            <p>Nominated by Aliw Awards as Best Dance Company in 2017, Daloy Dance Companyinterweaves dance, theatre and improvisation to create inventive and thought-provoking works. Daloy is committed to the appreciation and critical understanding of dance by realizing the creation of new choreographies by Ea Torrado and her collaborators and guest artists.</p>
                
            <p>Since its establishment in 2014, Daloy has made waves in the Manila art scene with polymorphic productions that play with the boundaries of contemporary dance (Pieces of Me, Banyuhay, The Sky Changed, Inter/Act); while other critically acclaimed works (Dysmorphilia, Canton, and Himalaya) invited audiences to both question and celebrate societal culture. With its strong collaborative thrust, the company has worked with notable visual artists in various museums and galleries in the Philippines.</p>
            
            ​
            <p>Daloy has enjoyed diverse audiences and performed in a range of dance and art festivals locally and abroad. We have worked with international guest teachers from Sweden, Singapore, USA, Australia, Canada to facilitate dance workshops for our dancers and students. Internationally we have performed at Low Fat Art Fest in Thailand, Goyang International Dance Festival in Korea, Lively Arts Performing Arts College in Pennsylvania & Cape Fear Community College for the Performing Arts in North Carolina, USA and Asia Performing Arts Market and Setouchi Trienalle in Japan. Our local presenters include KARNABAL Festival, Imaginarium Multi Arts Festival of the Absurd, FRINGE Manila Arts Festival, Malasimbo Lights and Dance Festival, Pasinaya Arts Festival, Dance MNL Festival, Aliw Theatre- International Dance Day Festival, Performatura Festival and Paghilom Festival. Daloy’s works were supported by The National Commission for Culture and the Arts, Japan Foundation Manila, Music Artes Inc., SIKAT Studio, Erehwon Arts Center, The PARC Foundation and Pineapple Lab.</p>
            
            ​
            
            <p>Capturing the energy and philosophy of Ea Torrado’s exploration of the human body as an instrument to provoke reflection and dialogue, and the capacity of dance performance to ignite creativity, connection and community, Daloy has produced Walang Hiya Festival, Sayaw Galaw, Ugnayan Community Program, Tanghal at Talakay and Daloy Movement, all projects that tapped diverse Filipino communities by utilizing dance as a tool for personal and social change.</p>
